Speak Your Mind - a Mobile Application for Memories and Emotions Management

1. Short description
 
Nowadays, people are very hesitant when it comes to talking about their emotions, feelings, memories or
what happend during their day. Because everyone has a busy schedule, for every human is hard
to find someone to talk to and unload the emotions felt in one day. These things lead to so many unknown feelings,
anxiety, depression and the list goes on.
Because it is very useful to keep track of all these feelings, emotions, memories, we would like to take advantage
of the evolution of technology.
Hence, Speak Your Mind is an application which allows the user to keep track of all these significant moments of
his life, in other words it will act just like a journal.

2. Domain details

Shortly, we should focus on our subject, the note
Story: title, text, emotion, date,  motivational_message

- title: represents the most significant words refering the story, which will be chosen by the user.
- text: represents the story itself which will be written by the user
- emotion: represents the most predominant emotion the human felt during that story
- date: represents the date in which the story took place
- motivational_message: represents a message the user write for himself, to help him overcome the difficulties
he's fighting.

3. How do we want to use this product?

- When using "Speak Your Mind", we want to be able to add a new story (note) to our journal, whenever something
new or what we think it's significant to our lives happen. So, we are thinking of a button, which redirects to a
separate page. Here, we can enter all the necessary information for our story.

- We want to have the option of listing all the registered notes together.

- People tend to forget some essential informations or emotions from a day, have grammar issues or simply found a
better title for the note, reason why it is mandatory to give the user the possibility to modify the notes.
We consider that a button for "update" is intuitive and by pressing it, the user will be redirected to a new page,
in the same manner as for the "add" option. Such a button will exist next to each item in the list.

- Because people sometimes wish to not remeber a specific story, they have already written, it is necessary to give
them the delete option. We would like to have a button, for "delete" action, next to each item in the list and a confirmation for
such an action, because that button may be pressed by accident or maybe the user just changes his mind.

4. How to we store our stories?

- We believe that the persistence is vital to our application, so we want it to be both connected to
a loval database and a server. This would make "Speak Your Mind" available online and offline too. 
For adding/updating/deleting a story we want to store the changes both ways, so they would be persisted on the
server and on the local database too.

- When the user is online, the data for listing our entities is taken from the
server (so updates are reflected immediately).

- When the user is offline, the temporary data is taken from the local database.

5. Whan happens if the user is offline?

- In this case, we want to develop an application which lets the user to add, remove and modify entries locally.
In this way, changes will persist only locally in the database. 

When the application is used offline, all the operations performed store the information locally:
-	the entities created are stored in the local database
-	the read operation is performed on the locally saved entities
-	the update operation goes for the locally saved entities
-	the delete operation is performed on the local database

- When the application goes back online, all the changes on the local database are transmitted to the server.
 
- As long as there is no internet connection, the notes are available only with the properties
previously saved in the database.
